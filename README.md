# CrayonAPI
Crayon API tool.

## Description
Crayon API receives data from the authorized client. The intention here is to extract the data through an API and push the received data calls into an SQL server. Currently CrayonAPI uses a Crayon SDK that is provided from the company, this contains references to class files, URL's and authorizations. 

## Tasks
DONE
- Successful API calls
- Authorization working (token accepted)
- Entity Framework correctly utilised
- Saves data to an SQL server 

TO DO
- Fix Invoice Profile Records for console output (depreciated code)
- Fix Invoices

## Usage
This program is used to manipulate data using the CrayonSDK package. All client methods are already built in the CrayonSDK package and are only referenced through the executable class (Program.cs). We will show an example for how an API is manipulated through the CrayonSDK package. 

This API document provides all the necessary API syntax that can be referenced through the CrayonSDK package. https://apidocs.crayon.com/

### Executable
A quick example from the project will show you how the referencing API commands work in this project, it's very simple and effective, here's one for getting a list of publishers.
```
var publishers = ApiClient.Publishers.Get(GetToken()).GetData();
```
Just like that the API is already obtained (since the Authorization details are already assigned at the top of the executable). Var publishers now contains an array of publisherâ€™s data from Crayon. This can now be easily saved to a Db by referencing the CrayonDbContext (which is powered by Entity Framework) like this. 
```
using (var db = new CrayonDbContext())
            {
                db.Publishers.AddRange(publishers);
                db.SaveChanges();
            }
```
Now data will be saved to the Publishers table in the SQL Server. However, if there isn't a Publishers table in the Database, then we will need to add one, this is where we need to modify the context. This will be shown in the next section of the readme. 

### Context
If you want to add a new table in the Crayon Database, it is easily done by adding a few lines of code and running a few commands. Let's follow through with the example that we are going to add a new Publishers table so Publishers data can now be stored in the Program. This is how the process would work. First, we would have to open up our Context class (CrayonDbContext.cs). Now we look where our DbSets are, currently we already have a Publishers DbSet, but for the sake of this example, we will pretend that we don't. We will add the DbSet in below like this.

```
public DbSet<Publisher> Publishers { get; set; }
```
Make sure that the DbSet<Publisher> is referenced correctly, that the metadata is linked to the CrayonSDK package. If so, that means it is referenced correctly. Then you give that entity a name, here we have it "Publishers" this is what it will be referred to as on the table, and in this project from now on. Once we have made the changes, we need to run a few commands so that the Database can be updated and generate a new table. Open up Package Manager Console and enter this command below. (Where it says [Insert name] it's just the name of the migration, make sure you don't give it the same name as a previous migration)
```
add-migration [insert name]
```
Now that a migration has been generated, it's time to update the database with one more command.
```
update-database
```
Now if you go to SQL Object Explorer, and refresh, you should see the new table from the DbSet you have generated. (If you have come into any problems with the migration, make sure to read the Entiy Framework document for assistance. A common case could be there's no ID, so you need to make the table keyless in modelBuilder). 

Now the database has been updated, you should be able to successfully reference the DbSet in your executable file and save any data there when you run the Program.
